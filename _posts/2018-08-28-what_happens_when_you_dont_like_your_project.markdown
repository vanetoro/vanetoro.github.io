If you read my previous posts, you know that I was almost completely done with my Rails Event Organizer App when I decided I hated it and wanted to do something else. Even after almost completing it, I wasn’t sure who the target audience would be or why anybody would want to use it over Facebook or a basic calendar. I know it's just a project but it felt useless and I was over it.

Two weeks ago as I was putting the finishing touches on my project, making sure I had completed all the requirements, I remembered something my technical coach had mentioned - in JavaScript we were going to add to this project. At that moment I thought what could I possibly add to my boring and unusable project? Nothing at all came to mind. So I started thinking about what I could build that I would actually want to keep working on after passing the rails assessment.

For the past few years living near New York City, I became more interested in art and specifically street art. Being out in NYC it’s hard to overlook. Recently it has also become a big thing amongst millennials because of Instagram. Not long after I dismissed my first project, while driving in the city on Canal Street I saw a new mural by Kobra. That's when I came up with the idea for my second project ‘NYC Street Art’!

I immediately got excited thinking about how my app would work and I started stubbing it out. I already had the basics down - artists have many murals, a mural belongs to an artist, and also belongs to a neighborhood. Murals would be my join table. I knew I had my previous project to refer to if/when I ran into problems.

So off I went, coding away, happy to be working on a project that I wasn't just doing because I had to.

At this moment I am at least a week behind where I should be in the program, but I am OK with it because I love my project. Now I am excited to work on it, to come up with new features and ideas and see them through. It really makes a difference to work on something that you like and are proud of.

My take away is to always work with what inspires you, even if it puts you a little behind, because you’ll enjoy the journey.e read my previous posts you'll know that I was almost completely done with my Rails Event Organizer app when I decided I hated it and wanted to do something else. 

Why did I hate it? Well after I almost completed it I was't sure who the target audience would be or why anybody would want to use it say compared to just using facebook or a calendar. I know it's just a project but it felt useless. 

I remember perfecttly that night, as it was just about two weeks ago. I was putting the finishing touches on it, as in I was making sure that I had completed all the requierments when I started remembering what my technical coach had mentioned. This was, that in javascript we were going to be adding to this project. At that moments I thought about what I could add to this rather bland project I had created. Nothing really came to mind and then I started thinking about what I could build that I would want to keep working on after passing the rails assesment. And that's where I came up with my second project, NYC Street Art! 

For the past few years I become more knowledgeable about art and street art. I think it has also become a thing, you know because of instagram. In any case I started thinking of how my app would work and it wasn't hard stub it out. I got the basics down.  Artists have many murals, a mural belongs to an artist and also belongs to a neighborhood. Murals would be my join table.

Alright so now I am behind at least a week at where I should be in the program. But it's ok I love this idea. And I already have my previous project to refer to if/when I have problems. Off I went, coding away  happy to be working on a project that I wasn't just doing because I had to. It really does make a difference to work on something that you like and are proud of.

The take away here is think things through and do things you like.
