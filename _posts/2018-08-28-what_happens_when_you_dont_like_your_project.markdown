If you've read my previous posts you'll know that I was almost completely done with my Rails Event Organizer app when I decided I hated it and wanted to do something else. 

Why did I hate it? Well after I almost completed it I was't sure who the target audience would be or why anybody would want to use it say compared to just using facebook or a calendar. I know it's just a project but it felt useless. 

I remember perfecttly that night, as it was just about two weeks ago. I was putting the finishing touches on it, as in I was making sure that I had completed all the requierments when I started remembering what my technical coach had mentioned. This was, that in javascript we were going to be adding to this project. At that moments I thought about what I could add to this rather bland project I had created. Nothing really came to mind and then I started thinking about what I could build that I would want to keep working on after passing the rails assesment. And that's where I came up with my second project, NYC Street Art! 

For the past few years I become more knowledgeable about art and street art. I think it has also become a thing, you know because of instagram. In any case I started thinking of how my app would work and it wasn't hard stub it out. I got the basics down.  Artists have many murals, a mural belongs to an artist and also belongs to a neighborhood. Murals would be my join table.

Alright so now I am behind at least a week at where I should be in the program. But it's ok I love this idea. And I already have my previous project to refer to if/when I have problems. Off I went, coding away  happy to be working on a project that I wasn't just doing because I had to. It really does make a difference to work on something that you like and are proud of.

The take away here is think things through and do things you like.
