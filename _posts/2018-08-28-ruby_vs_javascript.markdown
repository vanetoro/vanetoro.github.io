Wow the title sounds like I am going to write about a big battle between two languages but that’s not the case. I have now gotten to the point in this program where I have started coding with Javascript (JS) and the transition hasn’t been as easy as I expected.

I originally wanted to learn JS and I had done a few online courses and even attended a two week course before starting at the Flatiron school so I am so what familiar with JS. However, the fact that we were taught Ruby before JS has helped me so much. I remember struggling trying to understand certain concepts in JS. For example prototype methods, every time this came up I ran into a brick wall. Now I don’t know if it’s just ruby or that I have been coding 30 + hours a week for the past 3 and half months. But now that I saw the lesson on prototype methods I don’t understand why it had been such a hard concept to grasp.

Ruby is a wonderful language and I understand completely why it’s the right choice for a beginner. It’s so readable when you don’t know that much about coding and also it doesn’t have as much punctuation as JavaScript. JavaScript uses a lot more parenthesis and curly braces. It’s definitely easier to miss something and have the code break.

The one thing I must say I love and consider my best friend is PRY! This wonderful little gem is such a helpful guy. Always letting us look inside our code and help us debug and figure out why your code is not working or working differently than expected. I miss you old friend!

So far I have only used console.log but today I was told that I was going to be seeing debugger and this might be my next best friend. I am excited to meet you buddy! It’s always nice to have some help especially when you are just starting out and not quite sure what is happening under the hood.

In any case I am very excited to learn more about JS as I know it’s very powerful and that’s why it’s one of the most, if not the most popular language right now.
