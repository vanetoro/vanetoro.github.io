I have reached the end, well almost anyway. I still have to do the final project but I am here and very excited but also a little scared. Let me explain why I was feeling a little scared. 

During the whole time doing the curriculum I felt like it was a little tough but at the end of the day I usually understood all of the material and the further I got through it the better I felt. However, that wasn't the case when I got to JavaScript. I think it was the change to another language that stumped me and the testing on the labs was different and sometimes I could get everything to work but couldn't manage to get the test to pass, which was very frustration. Safe to say that it was a lot tougher than ruby. And as is should be since JavaScript is such a powerful language. So I get through that bumpy road that was JavaScript and arrive a React & Redux. Well here things weren't clicking at first but I got some help and clearly was able to arrive at the final project. The problem was that I wasn't as confident in myself as I had been with the previous projects but of course I wasn't going to let that stop me. 

I decided to build a CRUD app again. I have been working on these types of apps since my second project so I knew what I needed to build. This time I went with an app that keeps tracks of all the pop-up events going on in NYC. It's a huge thing that has taken over social media and I figured that people who like to go to these would love a place to see what Pop-Ups are currently going on. 

Building this project really helped me understand React so much better. When I started I was definitely not at the point that I am right now. It took me about 3 weeks to finish but I did everything I wanted to and now I have learned much more about React & Redux as well as Bootstrap and how to work with it with react, which is also another thing on to itself.
