So I have reached the end, well almost... I still have to complete the final review but I made it this far and I am feeling very accomplished. Reaching the end, I do have mixed emotions. I’m excited but also a little scared…

Working through the program I felt like the curriculum was very challenging, but at the end of the day I usually understood most of the material. The further I got through it the better and more confident I felt. However, when I got to JavaScript that all changed! I think the biggest obstacle was changing to another language. Although I speak both Spanish and English fluently, learning this second language stumped me. Also, the testing on the labs was different. More than once, I could get everything to work but couldn't manage to pass the test, which was very frustrating. For me, it was a lot tougher than ruby, which makes perfect sense because JavaScript is such a powerful language. So I work through the bumpy road that was JavaScript and arrive at React & Redux. Here things weren't exactly “clicking” at first but I got some help by attending study groups, Codecademy, and watching videos on YouTube. This by far was the hardest part of the program. It took me a long time to understand the way components work and why they are used the way they are.

After all of this, I was finally at the final project. Although I was excited to make it this far, I wasn't feeling as confident in myself because of the struggles I had with Javascript and React. But of course I wasn't going to let that stop me. 

I decided to build a CRUD app again. I have been working on these types of apps since my second project so I knew what I needed to build. This time I went with an app that keeps tracks of all the pop-up events going on in NYC. Pop-ups are a popular concept that has taken over social media in the past few years; and I figured that people who like to go to these would love an app to easily see what Pop-Ups are currently going on. 

After building this project I understand React so much better than before. It took me about 3 weeks to finish, which is almost double the time it took me to complete my last project. It doesn’t matter to me the extra time because I have learned so much more about React & Redux during the process.
